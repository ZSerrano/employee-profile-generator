# Module 10 Challenge - Employee Profile Generator

## Description
Created a functioning employee profile generator that allows the user to first create a manager profile with input information, and then proceed to create profiles for interns and engineers.  All of the responses to the prompts are stored in an array, and then once everything has been compiled, an index.html file is created, and each profile is appended to the index.html file in html script.
